# Blocklevel Frontend Test
> A simple Webpack setup with Sass.

## Before you begin
Make sure you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. Probably you already have this since most of modern development tools use NPM. When node.js is installed you can run the following command:
``` bash
$ npm install webpack -g
```
This will make the webpack command globally available.

Install the webpack-dev-server. This enables you to use the webpack-dev-server for any project you want.
``` bash
$ npm install webpack-dev-server -g
```

## Getting it up and running
Now [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io) is installed you can fork this repository. Check it out and install dependencies:
``` bash
$ npm install
```

Now all dependencies are installed you can run a dev server and show us your frontend skills:
``` bash
$ webpack-dev-server
```
The above command will provide a development server which you can see at http://localhost:8080.

## Show your skills
We've set up a PSD with a simple single page app which can be found in the root of this repository.

Keep in mind everything provided in the PSD must be implemented in your test. You are free to add as much awesomeness as you want. *Protip: We **love** the konami code*.

## Delivery
When you are done be sure to commit all your work. Then push it to your forked repository and share the Github url with us. We'll review your code and give you all the digital high fives you deserve.

Good luck. And have fun! :)
